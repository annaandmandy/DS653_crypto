        "In this challenge problem, you must design and implement a modified form of authenticated encryption that allows for a \"middlebox\" to be placed between the sender Alice and recipient Bob.\n",
        "\n",
        "- All ciphertexts will be transmitted as follows: Alice $\\to$ middlebox $\\to$ Bob.\n",
        "- Bob should be able to read Alice's messages, as normal.\n",
        "- The middlebox should be able to read the content of all of Alice's messages, but must **not** be able to modify the messages en route.\n",
        "- Bob should receive the usual authenticated encryption guarantees: that the messages was created by Alice and not tampered in transit. No one else, not even the middlebox, should be able to forge messages to look as though they were created by Alice.\n",
        "- The protocol should be fast; in particular, you should not use any public key cryptography.\n",
        "\n",
        "You may assume that Alice and Bob have agreed on a symmetric key $k$ beforehand. Your cryptographic protocol should include some way to generate a \"sub-key\" $k'$ from $k$, which will allow the middlebox to read but not alter data.\n",
        "\n",
        "(As a historical note: some companies used middleboxes to scan content for viruses sent via Transport Layer Security (TLS) before it was delivered to the computers on their enterprise network. This process was easier to perform with TLS 1.2, but newer changes made in the TLS 1.3 specification made this process more difficult. For this question though, you do not have to worry about the TLS specification or build any network communication.)"

Your description must explain clearly *what* design choices you have taken and *why* you made these decisions. (It is acceptable if your code executes locally; that is, there is no need to implement the network calls to communicate messages between different computers.)\n",
