They have hired you to keep their company's data safe and confidential. You must design and implement cryptographic systems to solve the following two tasks.\n",

        "1. The company has a USB stick that stores their long-term secrets. This drive is never re-written, so you can think of the USB stick as a single private message that must be protected for a long time. CrypCo is concerned that an employee might try to steal the company's secrets. To safeguard the data, you must build a mechanism to protect the USB stick in such a way that\n",

They want to outsource these files to the cloud -- and unlike in the previous task, these files may be updated over time. Alice is the CEO so she should be able to read all files at all times.
